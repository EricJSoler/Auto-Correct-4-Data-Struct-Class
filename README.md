# Auto-Correct-4-Data-Struct-Class
Auto Correct project we are writing in c# for our data structures class
The flag for inserting words that just extend off of an already owned words need to be fixed
i.e. inserting hello then hell will not store a flag at the second l in the hell. I believe this is because of acccessing memebers within the node structure
